# ch5creatingGoodTestData

Apply what you've learned in this chapter by predicting the output and finding errors in these problems, and by working on test cases to validate a program's logic.

In a Word document, specify the problem number, then provide your response to each of the problems below. 

Problem #1: (4 points) Predict the results for this code snippet. What will the display look like? 

int x = 1;
while (x < 10)
{
     x++;
     cout << x;
}

Problem #2: (4 points) Predict the results for this code snippet. What will the display look like?

int x = 1;
while (x < 10)
{
     cout << x;
     x += 2;

}

 

The following problem works through test cases and how to write good test cases to thoroughly test the logic as well as the calculations of your project.

Problem #3: (12 points) In the book, Section 5.13 presents a project and demonstrates the application of test cases. Create this project shown in Project 5-22; follow the instructions about testing it, using the simple test cases in table 5-2, and with the more complete test cases in table 5-3. Take screenshots of the results of each of the 3 test cases in table 5-3. In the Word document, explain what those 5 logic errors are. Edit the project as necessary to fix the logic errors discovered by using the test cases in table 5-3. Run the project with those 3 test cases again, and take screenshots of those fixed results, so you have "before" and "after" screenshots for each test case.

Submit the 6 screenshots, the explanation of the errors in the Word document, and the root folder of the project.

 

Submission: the Word document with your responses to the problems, plus the screenshots and root folder for the project in problem 3.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
