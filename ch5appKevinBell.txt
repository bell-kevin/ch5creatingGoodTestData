Problem #3

1. TotalScore just kept getting bigger and bigger. 
   It never reset. So a reset after each average calc. was needed

2. average never reset, so it also needed a reset after each student.

3. totalScore was an int, but it needs to be a double

4. score 1 if loop needs to be a while loop to check for repeated bad input
   score 2 if loop needs to be a while loop to check for repeated bad input

5. Extreme scores like 0 and 100 were not valid input before, but after scores 0 and 
   100 are accepted now as valid input
